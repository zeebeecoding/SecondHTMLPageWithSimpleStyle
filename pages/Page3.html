                <p>
                    When building web pages, we use a combination of non-semantic <span class="orange-bold">HTML</span> and
                    Semantic <span class="orange-bold">HTML</span>. The word semantic means <i> 
                    <b>"relating to meaning"</b> </i>, so  
                    semantic elements provide information about the content between the opening 
                    and closing tags.
                </p>
                <p>
                    By using Semantic <span class="orange-bold">HTML</span>, we select <span class="orange-bold">HTML</span> elements based on their meaning, not 
                    on how they are presented. Elements such as <span class="blue">&lt; div &gt; 
                    </span> and <span class="blue">&lt; span &gt;</span> are not semantic 
                    elements since they provide no context as to what is inside of those tags.
                </p>
                <p>
                    For example, instead of using a <span class="blue">&lt; div &gt;</span> 
                    element to contain our header information, we could use a <span class="blue">&lt; header &gt;</span> element, which is used as a heading 
                    section. By using a  <span class="blue">&lt; header &gt;</span> tag 
                    instead of a <span class="blue">&lt; div &gt;</span>, we provide context 
                    as to what information is inside of the opening and closing tag.

                <ul>
                    <li><b>Accessibility:</b> Semantic <span class="orange-bold">HTML</span> makes 
                     webpages accessible for mobile devices and for people with disabilities as 
                     well.This is because screen readers and browsers are able to interpret the 
                     code better. 
                    </li>
                </ul>
                    
                <ul>
                    <li><b>SEO:</b> It improves the website <b>SEO</b>, or <b>S</b>earch 
                         <b>E</b>ngine <b>O</b>ptimization, which is the process of increasing the 
                         number of people that visit your webpage. With better <b>SEO</b>, search 
                         engines are better able to identify the content of your website and 
                         weight the most important content appropriately. 
                    </li>
                </ul>
    
                <ul>
                    <li><b>Easy to Understand:</b> Semantic <span class="orange-bold">HTML</span> 
                         also makes the websites source code easier to read for other web 
                         developers.
                    </li>
                </ul>
    
                <p>
                    To better understand this, you can think of comparing non-semantic <span class="orange-bold">HTML</span> to going into a store with no signs on the 
                     aisles. Since the aisles aren't labeled, you don't know what products are in 
                     those aisles. However, stores that do have signs for each aisle make it a lot 
                     easier to find the items you need, just like Semantic <span class="orange- 
                     bold">HTML</span>.  
                </p>
    
                <p>
                 Many websites contain <span style="" class="orange-bold">HTML</span> code like: 
                 <span class="blue">&lt; div id="header" &gt;, &lt; div id="nav", 
                 &lt; div id="main" &gt;, &lt; div id="footer" &gt;</span> to 
                 indicate header, navigation, main content and footer.
                </p>
